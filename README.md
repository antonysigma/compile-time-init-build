# Opinionated fork of compile-time-init for AVR projects

Key changes:

- Cross-compile the example projects with Meson build system;
- Toolchain and 3rd party dependency management with Meson's WarpDB;
- AVR chipset support
- Compile-time logging support on 8-bit MCUs (`unsigned long -> unsigned 32-bit integer`)

## Quick start

1. Edit the path to the AVR gcc v12.0 toolchain in `avr-cross.ini`.

2. Install the build system.

```bash
python3 -m pip install meson ninja
```

3. Resolve build dependencies, and setup the build directory.
```bash
meson setup --cross-file=avr-cross.ini --buildtype=release build/
```

4. Compile to ELF file (Linker script not required.)
```bash
ninja -C build/ all
```

5. (Optional): convert the ELF format to ihex format
```bash
ninja -C build/ hex
```

6. Upload the ihex file to Arduino UNO
```bash
ninja -C build/ flash
```

7. (Not yet implemented) Write a Python script `cib_serial_monitor.py` that
   decodes the incoming streams from the serial port to formatted log messages.
   With/without logging levels.

# *cib* - Compile-time Initialization and Build

[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
[![Unit Tests](https://github.com/intel/compile-time-init-build/actions/workflows/unit_tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/intel/compile-time-init-build/actions/workflows/unit_tests.yml)

 *cib* is a C++ header-only library for building embedded firmware with reusable
components. It implements the compile-time initialization and build pattern. 
Instead of initializing components and registering callbacks at runtime, this
process is executed at compile-time using constexpr or consteval functions.

Firmware using *cib* is implemented as a collection of **components**. Each 
component provides **services** and **features** to the build. Component
**features** extend and provide new functionality to **services**.

As of the v1.0.0 release *cib*'s API is considered stable and unlikely to change.

## Sub-projects

There are multiple sub-projects contained within *cib*. Some of them are used
to implement *cib* and others extend *cib*.

* Services
    * [Flow](include/flow) - *cib* service used to compose sequences of dependent
      operations from multiple components.
    * [Callback](include/cib/callback.hpp) - *cib* service used to implement
      simple callback/listener pattern.
* Support
    * [string_constant](include/sc) - Compile-time string library with support for
      formatting similar to fmt/python format specifiers.
    * [log (wip)](include/log) - Logging library.
    * [Container](include/container) - Simple containers optimized for constexpr
      and/or free-standing applications.

## Compiler/Standard support

The main branch of *cib* currently uses C++20 and is tested with:
- Clang 14 thru 15
- GCC 12

An older version of *cib* that uses C++17 is tagged at v1.7.0. It
is tested with:
- Clang 9 thru 15
- GCC 9 thru 12

## Installing / Getting started

*cib* is released as a single header file as well as the zipped github repo. 
To get started quickly, download the cib.hpp header from the 
[release area](https://github.com/intel/compile-time-init-build/releases):

```shell
wget https://github.com/intel/compile-time-init-build/releases/download/v1.0.0/cib.hpp
```

Another option is to include cib as a 
[git submodule](https://github.blog/2016-02-01-working-with-submodules/) 
in your repo and add the cib directory in your CMakeLists.txt file:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(extern/compile-time-init-build)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE cib)
```

With either of these methods, include the cib.hpp header in your code to use it.

### Hello, world!

Since *cib* is a library for efficiently building firmware through composition
a simple example takes a few more lines than a typical "Hello, world!"

```c++
#include <cib/cib.hpp>
#include <iostream>

struct say_message : public cib::callback_meta<>{};

// the 'core' component exposes the 'say_message' service for others to extend
struct core {
    constexpr static auto config = cib::exports<say_message>;
};

// the 'say_hello_world' component extends 'say_message' with its own functionality
struct say_hello_world {
    constexpr static auto config =
        cib::extend<say_message>([](){
            std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;
        });
};

// the 'hello_world' project composes 'core' and 'say_hello_world'
struct hello_world {
    constexpr static auto config =
        cib::components<core, say_hello_world>;
};

// the nexus instantiates the project
cib::nexus<hello_world> nexus{};

int main() {
    // the fully extended and built services are ready to be used
    nexus.service<say_message>();
    return 0;
}
```

Try out this example live at [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/z/4rsfWaPnP).

A larger and more illustrative example can be found in this repo at
[examples/hello_world](examples/hello_world).

For more details on how to use *cib*, see the [User Guide](USER_GUIDE.md).

### Building

*cib* is built with CMake. The single header is built with the 
`release_header` target:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/intel/compile-time-init-build.git
cmake -B build
cmake --build build -t release_header
ls build/include/cib/ | grep cib.hpp
```

This combines all the *cib* header files in the `include` tree by recursively
including the `#include` directives and ignoring all other macros.

**NOTE:** *cib* uses [CPM.cmake](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) to
fetch its dependencies. When first running `cmake`, the dependencies will be
downloaded. To avoid re-downloading dependencies when reconfiguring cmake, it's
recommended to designate a cache directory and set the `CPM_SOURCE_CACHE`
environment variable.

Unit tests are registered with CTest, and will build and run as part of the
built-in `all` target.

```shell
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

This will build and run all the unit tests with Catch2 and GTest. To re-run them:

```shell
ctest --test-dir build
```
